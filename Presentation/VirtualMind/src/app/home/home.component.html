<p>Hi! I made a very simple solution to the problem. This week I was very busy with some clients migration to a new system.</p> <br />

<p>I did an API using ADO to persist my data because I have a generator, if you want I may create using Entity or Dapper.</p> <br />

<p>If you want make a call, I can explain everything I did.</p> <br />

<p>Thank you the opportunity.</p> <br />
